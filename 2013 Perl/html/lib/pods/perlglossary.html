<p>perlglossary - Perl Glossary</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>A glossary of terms (technical and otherwise) used in the Perl documentation. Other useful sources include the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing <a href="http://foldoc.org/">http://foldoc.org/</a>, the Jargon File <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/">http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/</a>, and Wikipedia <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="A">A</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="accessor-methods">accessor methods</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> used to indirectly inspect or update an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a>&#39;s state (its <a href="#instance-variable">instance variables</a>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="actual-arguments">actual arguments</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <a href="#scalar-value">scalar values</a> that you supply to a <a href="#function">&quot;function&quot;</a> or <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> when you call it. For instance, when you call <code><code>power(&quot;puff&quot;)</code></code>, the string <code><code>&quot;puff&quot;</code></code> is the actual argument. See also <a href="#argument">&quot;argument&quot;</a> and <a href="#formal-arguments">&quot;formal arguments&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="address-operator">address operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but this can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for handling all memory management. The closest to an address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it gives you a <a href="#hard-reference">&quot;hard reference&quot;</a>, which is much safer than a memory address.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="algorithm">algorithm</dt>
<dd>

<p>A well-defined sequence of steps, clearly enough explained that even a computer could do them.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="alias">alias</dt>
<dd>

<p>A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though you&#39;d used the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly created in the loop variable for <code><code>foreach</code></code> loops, in the <code><code>$_</code></code> variable for <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#map">map</a> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#grep">grep</a> operators, in <code><code>$a</code></code> and <code><code>$b</code></code> during <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#sort">sort</a>&#39;s comparison function, and in each element of <code><code>@_</code></code> for the <a href="#actual-arguments">&quot;actual arguments&quot;</a> of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly created in <a href="#package">packages</a> by <a href="#import">importing</a> symbols or by assignment to <a href="#typeglob">typeglobs</a>. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly created by the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#our">our</a> declaration.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="alternatives">alternatives</dt>
<dd>

<p>A list of possible choices from which you may select only one, as in &quot;Would you like door A, B, or C?&quot; Alternatives in regular expressions are separated with a single vertical bar: <code><code>|</code></code>. Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a double vertical bar: <code><code>||</code></code>. Logical alternatives in <a href="#Boolean">&quot;Boolean&quot;</a> expressions are separated with either <code><code>||</code></code> or <code><code>or</code></code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="anonymous">anonymous</dt>
<dd>

<p>Used to describe a <a href="#referent">&quot;referent&quot;</a> that is not directly accessible through a named <a href="#variable">&quot;variable&quot;</a>. Such a referent must be indirectly accessible through at least one <a href="#hard-reference">&quot;hard reference&quot;</a>. When the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="architecture">architecture</dt>
<dd>

<p>The kind of computer you&#39;re working on, where one &quot;kind&quot; of computer means all those computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the architecture it&#39;s running on than programs in other languages, such as C, that are compiled into machine code. See also <a href="#platform">&quot;platform&quot;</a> and <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="argument">argument</dt>
<dd>

<p>A piece of data supplied to a <a href="#executable-file">program</a>, <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a>, <a href="#function">&quot;function&quot;</a>, or <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> to tell it what it&#39;s supposed to do. Also called a &quot;parameter&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ARGV">ARGV</dt>
<dd>

<p>The name of the array containing the <a href="#argument">&quot;argument&quot;</a> <a href="#vector">&quot;vector&quot;</a> from the command line. If you use the empty <code><code>&lt;&gt;</code></code> operator, <a href="#ARGV">&quot;ARGV&quot;</a> is the name of both the <a href="#filehandle">&quot;filehandle&quot;</a> used to traverse the arguments and the <a href="#scalar">&quot;scalar&quot;</a> containing the name of the current input file.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="arithmetical-operator">arithmetical operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#symbol">&quot;symbol&quot;</a> such as <code><code>+</code></code> or <code><code>/</code></code> that tells Perl to do the arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="array">array</dt>
<dd>

<p>An ordered sequence of <a href="#value">values</a>, stored such that you can easily access any of the values using an integer <a href="#subscript">&quot;subscript&quot;</a> that specifies the value&#39;s <a href="#offset">&quot;offset&quot;</a> in the sequence.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="array-context">array context</dt>
<dd>

<p>An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to as <a href="#list-context">&quot;list context&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ASCII">ASCII</dt>
<dd>

<p>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a 7-bit character set adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes sometimes described as half ASCII. See also <a href="#Unicode">&quot;Unicode&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="assertion">assertion</dt>
<dd>

<p>A component of a <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> that must be true for the pattern to match but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often used specifically to mean a <a href="#zero-width">&quot;zero width&quot;</a> assertion.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="assignment">assignment</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> whose assigned mission in life is to change the value of a <a href="#variable">&quot;variable&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="assignment-operator">assignment operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>Either a regular <a href="#assignment">&quot;assignment&quot;</a>, or a compound <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> composed of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes the value of a variable in place, that is, relative to its old value. For example, <code><code>$a += 2</code></code> adds <code><code>2</code></code> to <code><code>$a</code></code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="associative-array">associative array</dt>
<dd>

<p>See <a href="#hash">&quot;hash&quot;</a>. Please.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="associativity">associativity</dt>
<dd>

<p>Determines whether you do the left <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> first or the right <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> first when you have &quot;A <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> B <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> C&quot; and the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like <code><code>+</code></code> are left associative, while operators like <code><code>**</code></code> are right associative. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlop.html">perlop</a> for a list of operators and their associativity.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="asynchronous">asynchronous</dt>
<dd>

<p>Said of events or activities whose relative temporal ordering is indeterminate because too many things are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous event is one you didn&#39;t know when to expect.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="atom">atom</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> component potentially matching a <a href="#substring">&quot;substring&quot;</a> containing one or more characters and treated as an indivisible syntactic unit by any following <a href="#quantifier">&quot;quantifier&quot;</a>. (Contrast with an <a href="#assertion">&quot;assertion&quot;</a> that matches something of <a href="#zero-width">&quot;zero width&quot;</a> and may not be quantified.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="atomic-operation">atomic operation</dt>
<dd>

<p>When Democritus gave the word &quot;atom&quot; to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally something that could not be cut: <i>a-</i> (not) + <i>tomos</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that can&#39;t be interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="attribute">attribute</dt>
<dd>

<p>A new feature that allows the declaration of <a href="#variable">variables</a> and <a href="#subroutine">subroutines</a> with modifiers as in <code><code>sub foo : locked method</code></code>. Also, another name for an <a href="#instance-variable">&quot;instance variable&quot;</a> of an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="autogeneration">autogeneration</dt>
<dd>

<p>A feature of <a href="#operator-overloading">&quot;operator overloading&quot;</a> of <a href="#object">objects</a>, whereby the behavior of certain <a href="#operator">operators</a> can be reasonably deduced using more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlop.html">perlop</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="autoincrement">autoincrement</dt>
<dd>

<p>To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the <code><code>++</code></code> operator. To instead subtract one from something automatically is known as an &quot;autodecrement&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="autoload">autoload</dt>
<dd>

<p>To load on demand. (Also called &quot;lazy&quot; loading.) Specifically, to call an <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsub.html#Autoloading">AUTOLOAD</a> subroutine on behalf of an undefined subroutine.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="autosplit">autosplit</dt>
<dd>

<p>To split a string automatically, as the <b>-a</b> <a href="#switch">&quot;switch&quot;</a> does when running under <b>-p</b> or <b>-n</b> in order to emulate <a href="#awk">&quot;awk&quot;</a>. (See also the <a href="../../lib/AutoSplit.html">AutoSplit</a> module, which has nothing to do with the <b>-a</b> switch, but a lot to do with autoloading.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="autovivification">autovivification</dt>
<dd>

<p>A Greco-Roman word meaning &quot;to bring oneself to life&quot;. In Perl, storage locations (<a href="#lvalue">lvalues</a>) spontaneously generate themselves as needed, including the creation of any <a href="#hard-reference">&quot;hard reference&quot;</a> values to point to the next level of storage. The assignment <code><code>$a[5][5][5][5][5] = &quot;quintet&quot;</code></code> potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar locations). But the point of autovivification is that you don&#39;t have to worry about it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="AV">AV</dt>
<dd>

<p>Short for &quot;array value&quot;, which refers to one of Perl&#39;s internal data types that holds an <a href="#array">&quot;array&quot;</a>. The <a href="#AV">&quot;AV&quot;</a> type is a subclass of <a href="#SV">&quot;SV&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="awk">awk</dt>
<dd>

<p>Descriptive editing term--short for &quot;awkward&quot;. Also coincidentally refers to a venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived some of its high-level ideas.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="B">B</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="backreference">backreference</dt>
<dd>

<p>A substring <a href="#capturing">captured</a> by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a <a href="#regex">&quot;regex&quot;</a>, also referred to as a capture group. The sequences (<code><code>\g1</code></code>, <code><code>\g2</code></code>, etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the pattern, the numbered variables (<code><code>$1</code></code>, <code><code>$2</code></code>, etc.) continue to refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current dynamic scope. <code><code><span class="operator">\</span><span class="variable">g</span><span class="operator">{-</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="operator">}</span>
</code></code> can be used to refer to a group by relative rather than absolute position; and groups can be also be named, and referred to later by name rather than number. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlre.html#Capture-groups">&quot;Capture groups&quot; in perlre</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="backtracking">backtracking</dt>
<dd>

<p>The practice of saying, &quot;If I had to do it all over, I&#39;d do it differently,&quot; and then actually going back and doing it all over differently. Mathematically speaking, it&#39;s returning from an unsuccessful recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to match patterns with a <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a>, and its earlier attempts don&#39;t pan out. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlre.html#Backtracking">&quot;Backtracking&quot; in perlre</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="backward-compatibility">backward compatibility</dt>
<dd>

<p>Means you can still run your old program because we didn&#39;t break any of the features or bugs it was relying on.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bareword">bareword</dt>
<dd>

<p>A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under <a href="../../lib/strict.html#strict-subs">use strict &#39;subs&#39;</a>. In the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="base-class">base class</dt>
<dd>

<p>A generic <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a> type; that is, a <a href="#class">&quot;class&quot;</a> from which other, more specific classes are derived genetically by <a href="#inheritance">&quot;inheritance&quot;</a>. Also called a &quot;superclass&quot; by people who respect their ancestors.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="big-endian">big-endian</dt>
<dd>

<p>From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the most significant <a href="#byte">&quot;byte&quot;</a> of a word at a lower byte address than the least significant byte. Often considered superior to little-endian machines. See also <a href="#little-endian">&quot;little-endian&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="binary">binary</dt>
<dd>

<p>Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means there&#39;s basically two numbers, 0 and 1. Also used to describe a &quot;non-text file&quot;, presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of <a href="#Unicode">&quot;Unicode&quot;</a>, this distinction, already suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="binary-operator">binary operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> that takes two <a href="#operand">operands</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bind">bind</dt>
<dd>

<p>To assign a specific <a href="#network-address">&quot;network address&quot;</a> to a <a href="#socket">&quot;socket&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bit">bit</dt>
<dd>

<p>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of a <a href="#byte">&quot;byte&quot;</a> or of a dollar. (The term &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; comes from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. That&#39;s why a 25-cent piece today is still &quot;two bits&quot;.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bit-shift">bit shift</dt>
<dd>

<p>The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which has the effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bit-string">bit string</dt>
<dd>

<p>A sequence of <a href="#bit">bits</a> that is actually being thought of as a sequence of bits, for once.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bless">bless</dt>
<dd>

<p>In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as in, &quot;The VP of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.&quot; Similarly in Perl, to grant official approval to a <a href="#referent">&quot;referent&quot;</a> so that it can function as an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a>, such as a WebCruncher object. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#bless">&quot;bless&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="block">block</dt>
<dd>

<p>What a <a href="#process">&quot;process&quot;</a> does when it has to wait for something: &quot;My process blocked waiting for the disk.&quot; As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large chunk of data, of a size that the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a> likes to deal with (normally a power of two such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data that&#39;s coming from or going to a disk file.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="BLOCK">BLOCK</dt>
<dd>

<p>A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl <a href="#statement">statements</a> that is delimited by braces. The <code><code>if</code></code> and <code><code>while</code></code> statements are defined in terms of <a href="#BLOCK">BLOCKs</a>, for instance. Sometimes we also say &quot;block&quot; to mean a lexical scope; that is, a sequence of statements that act like a <a href="#BLOCK">&quot;BLOCK&quot;</a>, such as within an <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</a> or a file, even though the statements aren&#39;t delimited by braces.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="block-buffering">block buffering</dt>
<dd>

<p>A method of making input and output efficient by passing one <a href="#block">&quot;block&quot;</a> at a time. By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See <a href="#buffer">&quot;buffer&quot;</a> and <a href="#command-buffering">&quot;command buffering&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Boolean">Boolean</dt>
<dd>

<p>A value that is either <a href="#true">&quot;true&quot;</a> or <a href="#false">&quot;false&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Boolean-context">Boolean context</dt>
<dd>

<p>A special kind of <a href="#scalar-context">&quot;scalar context&quot;</a> used in conditionals to decide whether the <a href="#scalar-value">&quot;scalar value&quot;</a> returned by an expression is <a href="#true">&quot;true&quot;</a> or <a href="#false">&quot;false&quot;</a>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a number. See <a href="#context">&quot;context&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="breakpoint">breakpoint</dt>
<dd>

<p>A spot in your program where you&#39;ve told the debugger to stop <a href="#execute">execution</a> so you can poke around and see whether anything is wrong yet.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="broadcast">broadcast</dt>
<dd>

<p>To send a <a href="#datagram">&quot;datagram&quot;</a> to multiple destinations simultaneously.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="BSD">BSD</dt>
<dd>

<p>A psychoactive drug, popular in the 80s, probably developed at U. C. Berkeley or thereabouts. Similar in many ways to the prescription-only medication called &quot;System V&quot;, but infinitely more useful. (Or, at least, more fun.) The full chemical name is &quot;Berkeley Standard Distribution&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bucket">bucket</dt>
<dd>

<p>A location in a <a href="#hash-table">&quot;hash table&quot;</a> containing (potentially) multiple entries whose keys &quot;hash&quot; to the same hash value according to its hash function. (As internal policy, you don&#39;t have to worry about it, unless you&#39;re into internals, or policy.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="buffer">buffer</dt>
<dd>

<p>A temporary holding location for data. <a href="#block-buffering">Block buffering</a> means that the data is passed on to its destination whenever the buffer is full. <a href="#line-buffering">Line buffering</a> means that it&#39;s passed on whenever a complete line is received. <a href="#command-buffering">Command buffering</a> means that it&#39;s passed every time you do a <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#print">print</a> command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time without the use of a holding area. This can be rather inefficient.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="built-in">built-in</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#function">&quot;function&quot;</a> that is predefined in the language. Even when hidden by <a href="#overriding">&quot;overriding&quot;</a>, you can always get at a built-in function by <a href="#qualified">qualifying</a> its name with the <code><code>CORE::</code></code> pseudo-package.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bundle">bundle</dt>
<dd>

<p>A group of related modules on <a href="#CPAN">&quot;CPAN&quot;</a>. (Also, sometimes refers to a group of command-line switches grouped into one <a href="#switch-cluster">&quot;switch cluster&quot;</a>.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="byte">byte</dt>
<dd>

<p>A piece of data worth eight <a href="#bit">bits</a> in most places.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="bytecode">bytecode</dt>
<dd>

<p>A pidgin-like language spoken among &#39;droids when they don&#39;t wish to reveal their orientation (see <a href="#endian">&quot;endian&quot;</a>). Named after some similar languages spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and interpreters in the late 20th century. These languages are characterized by representing everything as a non-architecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="C">C</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="C1">C</dt>
<dd>

<p>A language beloved by many for its inside-out <a href="#type">&quot;type&quot;</a> definitions, inscrutable <a href="#precedence">&quot;precedence&quot;</a> rules, and heavy <a href="#overloading">&quot;overloading&quot;</a> of the function-call mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than upper.) Perl is written in C, so it&#39;s not surprising that Perl borrowed a few ideas from it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="C-preprocessor">C preprocessor</dt>
<dd>

<p>The typical C compiler&#39;s first pass, which processes lines beginning with <code><code><span class="comment">#</span>
</code></code> for conditional compilation and macro definition and does various manipulations of the program text based on the current definitions. Also known as <i>cpp</i>(1).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="call-by-reference">call by reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#argument">&quot;argument&quot;</a>-passing mechanism in which the <a href="#formal-arguments">&quot;formal arguments&quot;</a> refer directly to the <a href="#actual-arguments">&quot;actual arguments&quot;</a>, and the <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> can change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. That is, the formal argument is an <a href="#alias">&quot;alias&quot;</a> for the actual argument. See also <a href="#call-by-value">&quot;call by value&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="call-by-value">call by value</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#argument">&quot;argument&quot;</a>-passing mechanism in which the <a href="#formal-arguments">&quot;formal arguments&quot;</a> refer to a copy of the <a href="#actual-arguments">&quot;actual arguments&quot;</a>, and the <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> cannot change the actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. See also <a href="#call-by-reference">&quot;call by reference&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="callback">callback</dt>

<p>These two terms are synonymous: a <a href="#capturing">captured substring</a> by a regex subpattern.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="capturing">capturing</dt>
<dd>

<p>The use of parentheses around a <a href="#subpattern">&quot;subpattern&quot;</a> in a <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> to store the matched <a href="#substring">&quot;substring&quot;</a> as a <a href="#backreference">&quot;backreference&quot;</a> or <a href="#capture-buffer-capture-group">capture group</a>.

</dd>
<dt id="character">character</dt>
<dd>

<p>A small integer representative of a unit of orthography. Historically, characters were usually stored as fixed-width integers (typically in a byte, or maybe two, depending on the character set), but with the advent of UTF-8, characters are often stored in a variable number of bytes depending on the size of the integer that represents the character. Perl manages this transparently for you, for the most part.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="character-class">character class</dt>
<dd>

<p>A square-bracketed list of characters used in a <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> to indicate that any character of the set may occur at a given point. Loosely, any predefined set of characters so used.</p>

<dd>

<p>A predefined <a href="#character-class">&quot;character class&quot;</a> matchable by the <code><code>\p</code></code> <a href="#metasymbol">&quot;metasymbol&quot;</a>. Many standard properties are defined for <a href="#Unicode">&quot;Unicode&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="circumfix-operator">circumfix operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> that surrounds its <a href="#operand">&quot;operand&quot;</a>, like the angle operator, or parentheses, or a hug.</p>

<dt id="class">class</dt>
<dd>

<p>A user-defined <a href="#type">&quot;type&quot;</a>, implemented in Perl via a <a href="#package">&quot;package&quot;</a> that provides (either directly or by inheritance) <a href="#method">methods</a> (that is, <a href="#subroutine">subroutines</a>) to handle <a href="#instance">instances</a> of the class (its <a href="#object">objects</a>). See also <a href="#inheritance">&quot;inheritance&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="class-method">class method</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> whose <a href="#invocant">&quot;invocant&quot;</a> is a <a href="#package">&quot;package&quot;</a> name, not an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a> reference. A method associated with the class as a whole.</p>

<p>An <a href="#anonymous">&quot;anonymous&quot;</a> subroutine that, when a reference to it is generated at run time, keeps track of the identities of externally visible <a href="#lexical-variable">lexical variables</a> even after those lexical variables have supposedly gone out of <a href="#scope">&quot;scope&quot;</a>. They&#39;re called &quot;closures&quot; because this sort of behavior gives mathematicians a sense of closure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="cluster">cluster</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="code-point">code point</dt>
<dd>

<p>The position of a character in a character set encoding. The character <code><code>NULL</code></code> is almost certainly at the zeroth position in all character sets, so its code point is 0. The code point for the <code><code>SPACE</code></code> character in the ASCII character set is 0x20, or 32 decimal; in EBCDIC it is 0x40, or 64 decimal. The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#ord">ord</a> function returns the code point of a character.</p>

<p>&quot;code position&quot; and &quot;ordinal&quot; mean the same thing as &quot;code point&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="code-subpattern">code subpattern</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> subpattern whose real purpose is to execute some Perl code, for example, the <code><code>(?{...})</code></code> and <code><code><span class="operator">(</span><span class="regex">??</span><span class="operator">{...})</span>
</code></code> subpatterns.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="collating-sequence">collating sequence</dt>
<dd>

<p>The order into which <a href="#character">characters</a> sort. This is used by <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> comparison routines to decide, for example, where in this glossary to put &quot;collating sequence&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="command">command</dt>
<dd>

<p>In <a href="#shell">&quot;shell&quot;</a> programming, the syntactic combination of a program name and its arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a command interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even more loosely, a Perl <a href="#statement">&quot;statement&quot;</a>, which might start with a <a href="#label">&quot;label&quot;</a> and typically ends with a semicolon.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="command-buffering">command buffering</dt>
<dd>

<p>A mechanism in Perl that lets you store up the output of each Perl <a href="#command">&quot;command&quot;</a> and then flush it out as a single request to the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a>. It&#39;s enabled by setting the <code><code>$|</code></code> (<code><code>$AUTOFLUSH</code></code>) variable to a true value. It&#39;s used when you don&#39;t want data sitting around not going where it&#39;s supposed to, which may happen because the default on a <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> or <a href="#pipe">&quot;pipe&quot;</a> is to use <a href="#block-buffering">&quot;block buffering&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="command-name">command name</dt>
<dd>

<p>The name of the program currently executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the <a href="#command">&quot;command&quot;</a> name is passed to the program as the first command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately as <code><code>$0</code></code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="command-line-arguments">command-line arguments</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <a href="#value">values</a> you supply along with a program name when you tell a <a href="#shell">&quot;shell&quot;</a> to execute a <a href="#command">&quot;command&quot;</a>. These values are passed to a Perl program through <code><code>@ARGV</code></code>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="comment">comment</dt>
<dd>

<p>A remark that doesn&#39;t affect the meaning of the program. In Perl, a comment is introduced by a <code><code><span class="comment">#</span>

</dd>
<dt id="compilation-unit">compilation unit</dt>
<dd>

<p>The <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> (or <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a>, in the case of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</a>) that is currently being compiled.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="compile-phase">compile phase</dt>
<dd>

<p>Any time before Perl starts running your main program. See also <a href="#run-phase">&quot;run phase&quot;</a>. Compile phase is mostly spent in <a href="#compile-time">&quot;compile time&quot;</a>, but may also be spent in <a href="#run-time">&quot;run time&quot;</a> when <code><code>BEGIN</code></code> blocks, <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#use">use</a> declarations, or constant subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and import code of any <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#use">use</a> declaration is also run during compile phase.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="compile-time">compile time</dt>
<dd>

<p>The time when Perl is trying to make sense of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it knows what your code means and is merely trying to do what it thinks your code says to do, which is <a href="#run-time">&quot;run time&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="compiler">compiler</dt>
<dd>

<p>Strictly speaking, a program that munches up another program and spits out yet another file containing the program in a &quot;more executable&quot; form, typically containing native machine instructions. The <i>perl</i> program is not a compiler by this definition, but it does contain a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form (<a href="#syntax-tree">syntax trees</a>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the <a href="#interpreter">&quot;interpreter&quot;</a> then interprets. There are, however, extension <a href="#module">modules</a> to get Perl to act more like a &quot;real&quot; compiler. See <a href="../../lib/O.html">O</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="composer">composer</dt>
<dd>

<p>A &quot;constructor&quot; for a <a href="#referent">&quot;referent&quot;</a> that isn&#39;t really an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a>, like an anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter). For example, a pair of braces acts as a composer for a hash, and a pair of brackets acts as a composer for an array. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlref.html#Making-References">&quot;Making References&quot; in perlref</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="concatenation">concatenation</dt>

<dt id="connection">connection</dt>
<dd>

<p>In telephony, the temporary electrical circuit between the caller&#39;s and the callee&#39;s phone. In networking, the same kind of temporary circuit between a <a href="#client">&quot;client&quot;</a> and a <a href="#server">&quot;server&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="construct">construct</dt>
<dd>

<p>As a noun, a piece of syntax made up of smaller pieces. As a transitive verb, to create an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a> using a <a href="#constructor">&quot;constructor&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="constructor">constructor</dt>
<dd>

<p>Any <a href="#class-method">&quot;class method&quot;</a>, instance <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a>, or <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> that composes, initializes, blesses, and returns an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a>. Sometimes we use the term loosely to mean a <a href="#composer">&quot;composer&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="context">context</dt>
<dd>

<p>The surroundings, or environment. The context given by the surrounding code determines what kind of data a particular <a href="#expression">&quot;expression&quot;</a> is expected to return. The three primary contexts are <a href="#list-context">&quot;list context&quot;</a>, <a href="#scalar-context">&quot;scalar context&quot;</a>, and <a href="#void-context">&quot;void context&quot;</a>. Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into <a href="#Boolean-context">&quot;Boolean context&quot;</a>, <a href="#numeric-context">&quot;numeric context&quot;</a>, <a href="#string-context">&quot;string context&quot;</a>, and <a href="#void-context">&quot;void context&quot;</a>.

</dd>
<dt id="continuation">continuation</dt>
<dd>

<p>The treatment of more than one physical <a href="#line">&quot;line&quot;</a> as a single logical line. <a href="#Makefile">&quot;Makefile&quot;</a> lines are continued by putting a backslash before the <a href="#newline">&quot;newline&quot;</a>. Mail headers as defined by RFC 822 are continued by putting a space or tab <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in Perl do not need any form of continuation mark, because <a href="#whitespace">&quot;whitespace&quot;</a> (including newlines) is gleefully ignored. Usually.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="core-dump">core dump</dt>
<dd>

<p>The corpse of a <a href="#process">&quot;process&quot;</a>, in the form of a file left in the <a href="#working-directory">&quot;working directory&quot;</a> of the process, usually as a result of certain kinds of fatal error.</p>

<dt id="dangling-statement">dangling statement</dt>
<dd>

<p>A bare, single <a href="#statement">&quot;statement&quot;</a>, without any braces, hanging off an <code><code>if</code></code> or <code><code>while</code></code> conditional. C allows them. Perl doesn&#39;t.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="data-structure">data structure</dt>
<dd>

<p>How your various pieces of data relate to each other and what shape they make when you put them all together, as in a rectangular table or a triangular-shaped tree.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="data-type">data type</dt>
<dd>

<p>A set of possible values, together with all the operations that know how to deal with those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain set of numbers that you can work with and various mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers but would make little sense on, say, a string such as <code><code>&quot;Kilroy&quot;</code></code>. Strings have their own operations, such as <a href="#concatenation">&quot;concatenation&quot;</a>. Compound types made of a number of smaller pieces generally have operations to compose and decompose them, and perhaps to rearrange them. <a href="#object">Objects</a> that model things in the real world often have operations that correspond to real activities. For instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator object might have an <code><code>open_door()</code></code> <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="datagram">datagram</dt>
<dd>

<p>A packet of data, such as a <a href="#UDP">&quot;UDP&quot;</a> message, that (from the viewpoint of the programs involved) can be sent independently over the network. (In fact, all packets are sent independently at the <a href="#IP">&quot;IP&quot;</a> level, but <a href="#stream">&quot;stream&quot;</a> protocols such as <a href="#TCP">&quot;TCP&quot;</a> hide this from your program.)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DBM">DBM</dt>
<dd>

<p>Stands for &quot;Data Base Management&quot; routines, a set of routines that emulate an <a href="#associative-array">&quot;associative array&quot;</a> using disk files. The routines use a dynamic hashing scheme to locate any entry with only two disk accesses. DBM files allow a Perl program to keep a persistent <a href="#hash">&quot;hash&quot;</a> across multiple invocations. You can <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tie">tie</a> your hash variables to various DBM implementations--see <a href="../../lib/AnyDBM_File.html">AnyDBM_File</a> and <a>DB_File</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="declaration">declaration</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#assertion">&quot;assertion&quot;</a> that states something exists and perhaps describes what it&#39;s like, without giving any commitment as to how or where you&#39;ll use it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says, &quot;two cups flour, one large egg, four or five tadpoles...&quot; See <a href="#statement">&quot;statement&quot;</a> for its opposite. Note that some declarations also function as statements. Subroutine declarations also act as definitions if a body is supplied.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="decrement">decrement</dt>
<dd>

<p>To subtract a value from a variable, as in &quot;decrement <code><code>$x</code></code>&quot; (meaning to remove 1 from its value) or &quot;decrement <code><code>$x</code></code> by 3&quot;.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="default">default</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="defined">defined</dt>
<dd>

<p>Having a meaning. Perl thinks that some of the things people try to do are devoid of meaning, in particular, making use of variables that have never been given a <a href="#value">&quot;value&quot;</a> and performing certain operations on data that isn&#39;t there. For example, if you try to read data past the end of a file, Perl will hand you back an undefined value. See also <a href="#false">&quot;false&quot;</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#defined">&quot;defined&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="delimiter">delimiter</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#character">&quot;character&quot;</a> or <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> that sets bounds to an arbitrarily-sized textual object, not to be confused with a <a href="#separator">&quot;separator&quot;</a> or <a href="#terminator">&quot;terminator&quot;</a>. &quot;To delimit&quot; really just means &quot;to surround&quot; or &quot;to enclose&quot; (like these parentheses are doing).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="deprecated-modules-and-features">deprecated modules and features</dt>
<dd>

<p>Deprecated modules and features are those which were part of a stable release, but later found to be subtly flawed, and which should be avoided. They are subject to removal and/or bug-incompatible reimplementation in the next major release (but they will be preserved through maintenance releases). Deprecation warnings are issued under <b>-w</b> or <code><code>use diagnostics</code></code>, and notices are found in <a href="../../lib/pods/perldelta.html">perldelta</a>s, as well as various other PODs. Coding practices that misuse features, such as <code><code>my $foo if 0</code></code>, can also be deprecated.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="dereference">dereference</dt>
<dd>

<p>A fancy computer science term meaning &quot;to follow a <a href="#reference">&quot;reference&quot;</a> to what it points to&quot;. The &quot;de&quot; part of it refers to the fact that you&#39;re taking away one level of <a href="#indirection">&quot;indirection&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="#class">&quot;class&quot;</a> that defines some of its <a href="#method">methods</a> in terms of a more generic class, called a <a href="#base-class">&quot;base class&quot;</a>. Note that classes aren&#39;t classified exclusively into base classes or derived classes: a class can function as both a derived class and a base class simultaneously, which is kind of classy.</p>

<dt id="destructor">destructor</dt>
<dd>

<p>A special <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> that is called when an <a href="#object">&quot;object&quot;</a> is thinking about <a href="#destroy">destroying</a> itself. A Perl program&#39;s <code><code>DESTROY</code></code> method doesn&#39;t do the actual destruction; Perl just <a href="#trigger">triggers</a> the method in case the <a href="#class">&quot;class&quot;</a> wants to do any associated cleanup.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="device">device</dt>
<dd>

<p>A whiz-bang hardware gizmo (like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a joystick or a mouse) attached to your computer, that the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a> tries to make look like a <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> (or a bunch of files). Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the <i>/dev</i> directory.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="dispatch">dispatch</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="distribution">distribution</dt>
<dd>

<p>A standard, bundled release of a system of software. The default usage implies source code is included. If that is not the case, it will be called a &quot;binary-only&quot; distribution.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="to-be-dropped-modules">(to be) dropped modules</dt>
<dd>

<p>When Perl 5 was first released (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perlhist.html">perlhist</a>), several modules were included, which have now fallen out of common use. It has been suggested that these modules should be removed, since the distribution became rather large, and the common criterion for new module additions is now limited to modules that help to build, test, and extend perl itself. Furthermore, the CPAN (which didn&#39;t exist at the time of Perl 5.0) can become the new home of dropped modules. Dropping modules is currently not an option, but further developments may clear the last barriers.</p>

<dt id="dweomer">dweomer</dt>
<dd>

<p>An enchantment, illusion, phantasm, or jugglery. Said when Perl&#39;s magical <a href="#dwimmer">&quot;dwimmer&quot;</a> effects don&#39;t do what you expect, but rather seem to be the product of arcane dweomercraft, sorcery, or wonder working. [From Old English]</p>

</dd>
<dt id="dwimmer">dwimmer</dt>
<dd>

<p>DWIM is an acronym for &quot;Do What I Mean&quot;, the principle that something should just do what you want it to do without an undue amount of fuss. A bit of code that does &quot;dwimming&quot; is a &quot;dwimmer&quot;. Dwimming can require a great deal of behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesn&#39;t stay properly behind the scenes) is called a <a href="#dweomer">&quot;dweomer&quot;</a> instead.</p>

<dt id="fatal-error">fatal error</dt>
<dd>

<p>An uncaught <a href="#exception">&quot;exception&quot;</a>, which causes termination of the <a href="#process">&quot;process&quot;</a> after printing a message on your <a href="#standard-error">&quot;standard error&quot;</a> stream. Errors that happen inside an <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</a> are not fatal. Instead, the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</a> terminates after placing the exception message in the <code><code>$@</code></code> (<code><code>$EVAL_ERROR</code></code>) variable. You can try to provoke a fatal error with the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#die">die</a> operator (known as throwing or raising an exception), but this may be caught by a dynamically enclosing <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#eval">eval</a>. If not caught, the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#die">die</a> becomes a fatal error.</p>

<dt id="file">file</dt>
<dd>

<p>A named collection of data, usually stored on disk in a <a href="#directory">&quot;directory&quot;</a> in a <a href="#filesystem">&quot;filesystem&quot;</a>. Roughly like a document, if you&#39;re into office metaphors. In modern filesystems, you can actually give a file more than one name. Some files have special properties, like directories and devices.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="file-descriptor">file descriptor</dt>
<dd>

<p>The little number the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a> uses to keep track of which opened <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> you&#39;re talking about. Perl hides the file descriptor inside a <a href="#standard-I-O">&quot;standard I/O&quot;</a> stream and then attaches the stream to a <a href="#filehandle">&quot;filehandle&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="file-test-operator">file test operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>A built-in unary operator that you use to determine whether something is <a href="#true">&quot;true&quot;</a> about a file, such as <code><code>-o $filename</code></code> to test whether you&#39;re the owner of the file.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="filehandle">filehandle</dt>
<dd>

<p>An identifier (not necessarily related to the real name of a file) that represents a particular instance of opening a file until you close it. If you&#39;re going to open and close several different files in succession, it&#39;s fine to open each of them with the same filehandle, so you don&#39;t have to write out separate code to process each file.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="filename">filename</dt>
<dd>

<p>One name for a file. This name is listed in a <a href="#directory">&quot;directory&quot;</a>, and you can use it in an <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#open">open</a> to tell the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a> exactly which file you want to open, and associate the file with a <a href="#filehandle">&quot;filehandle&quot;</a> which will carry the subsequent identity of that file in your program, until you close it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="filesystem">filesystem</dt>
<dd>

<p>A set of <a href="#directory">directories</a> and <a href="#file">files</a> residing on a partition of the disk. Sometimes known as a &quot;partition&quot;. You can change the file&#39;s name or even move a file around from directory to directory within a filesystem without actually moving the file itself, at least under Unix.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="filter">filter</dt>
<dd>

<p>A program designed to take a <a href="#stream">&quot;stream&quot;</a> of input and transform it into a stream of output.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="flag">flag</dt>
<dd>

<p>We tend to avoid this term because it means so many things. It may mean a command-line <a href="#switch">&quot;switch&quot;</a> that takes no argument itself (such as Perl&#39;s <b>-n</b> and <b>-p</b> flags) or, less frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the <code><code>O_CREAT</code></code> and <code><code>O_EXCL</code></code> flags used in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#sysopen">sysopen</a>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="floating-point">floating point</dt>
<dd>

<p>A method of storing numbers in &quot;scientific notation&quot;, such that the precision of the number is independent of its magnitude (the decimal point &quot;floats&quot;). Perl does its numeric work with floating-point numbers (sometimes called &quot;floats&quot;), when it can&#39;t get away with using <a href="#integer">integers</a>. Floating-point numbers are mere approximations of real numbers.</p>

<dt id="formal-arguments">formal arguments</dt>
<dd>

<p>The generic names by which a <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> knows its <a href="#argument">arguments</a>. In many languages, formal arguments are always given individual names, but in Perl, the formal arguments are just the elements of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program are <code><code>$ARGV[0]</code></code>, <code><code>$ARGV[1]</code></code>, and so on. Similarly, the formal arguments to a Perl subroutine are <code><code>$_[0]</code></code>, <code><code>$_[1]</code></code>, and so on. You may give the arguments individual names by assigning the values to a <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#my">my</a> list. See also <a href="#actual-arguments">&quot;actual arguments&quot;</a>.</p>

<dt id="freeware">freeware</dt>
<dd>

<p>Historically, any software that you give away, particularly if you make the source code available as well. Now often called <code><code>open source software</code></code>. Recently there has been a trend to use the term in contradistinction to <a href="#open-source-software">&quot;open source software&quot;</a>, to refer only to free software released under the Free Software Foundation&#39;s GPL (General Public License), but this is difficult to justify etymologically.</p>

<p>Mathematically, a mapping of each of a set of input values to a particular output value. In computers, refers to a <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> or <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> that returns a <a href="#value">&quot;value&quot;</a>.

<dd>

<p>A misnamed feature--it should be called, &quot;expecting your mother to pick up after you&quot;. Strictly speaking, Perl doesn&#39;t do this, but it relies on a reference-counting mechanism to keep things tidy. However, we rarely speak strictly and will often refer to the reference-counting scheme as a form of garbage collection. (If it&#39;s any comfort, when your interpreter exits, a &quot;real&quot; garbage collector runs to make sure everything is cleaned up if you&#39;ve been messy with circular references and such.)</p>

<dd>

<p>Strictly, the shell&#39;s <code><code>*</code></code> character, which will match a &quot;glob&quot; of characters when you&#39;re trying to generate a list of filenames.

<dt id="grep">grep</dt>
<dd>

<p>Originally from the old Unix editor command for &quot;Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print it&quot;, now used in the general sense of any kind of search, especially text searches. Perl has a built-in <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#grep">grep</a> function that searches a list for elements matching any given criterion, whereas the <i>grep</i>(1) program searches for lines matching a <a href="#regular-expression">&quot;regular expression&quot;</a> in one or more files.</p>

(Some hard references are held internally, such as the implicit reference from one of a <a href="#typeglob">&quot;typeglob&quot;</a>&#39;s variable slots to its corresponding referent.) A hard reference is different from a <a href="#symbolic-reference">&quot;symbolic reference&quot;</a>.</p>

This glossary is like a hash, where the word to be defined is the key, and the definition is the value. A hash is also sometimes septisyllabically called an &quot;associative array&quot;, which is a pretty good reason for simply calling it a &quot;hash&quot; instead. A hash can optionally be <a href="#restricted-hash">restricted</a> to a fixed set of keys.</p>

<p>A file containing certain required definitions that you must include &quot;ahead&quot; of the rest of your program to do certain obscure operations. A C header file has a <i>.h</i> extension. Perl doesn&#39;t really have header files, though historically Perl has sometimes used translated <i>.h</i> files with a <i>.ph</i> extension.

<dt id="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</dt>
<dd>

<p>A number in base 16, &quot;hex&quot; for short. The digits for 10 through 16 are customarily represented by the letters <code><code>a</code></code> through <code><code>f</code></code>.

<dt id="identifier">identifier</dt>
<dd>

<p>A legally formed name for most anything in which a computer program might be interested. Many languages (including Perl) allow identifiers that start with a letter and contain letters and digits.

</dd>
<dt id="impatience">impatience</dt>

<p>The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don&#39;t just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least that pretend to.

<pre><code><code>  <span class="variable">$gollum</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="variable">new</span> <span class="variable">Pathetic::Creature</span> <span class="string">"Smeagol"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
  <span class="variable">give</span> <span class="variable">$gollum</span> <span class="string">"Fisssssh!"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
  <span class="variable">give</span> <span class="variable">$gollum</span> <span class="string">"Precious!"</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</code></code></pre>

<p>In modern Perl, calling methods this way is often considered bad practice and to be avoided.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="indirect-object-slot">indirect object slot</dt>
<dd>

<p>The syntactic position falling between a method call and its arguments when using the indirect object invocation syntax. (The slot is distinguished by the absence of a comma between it and the next argument.) <a href="#STDERR">&quot;STDERR&quot;</a> is in the indirect object slot here:</p>

<pre><code><code>  <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="variable">STDERR</span> <span class="string">"Awake!  Awake!  Fear, Fire,
      Foes!  Awake!\n"</span><span class="operator">;</span>

<dt id="interpolation">interpolation</dt>
<dd>

<p>The insertion of a scalar or list value somewhere in the middle of another value, such that it appears to have been there all along. In Perl, variable interpolation happens in double-quoted strings and patterns, and list interpolation occurs when constructing the list of values to pass to a list operator or other such construct that takes a <a href="#LIST">&quot;LIST&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="interpreter">interpreter</dt>
<dd>

<p>Strictly speaking, a program that reads a second program and does what the second program says directly without turning the program into a different form first, which is what <a href="#compiler">compilers</a> do. Perl is not an interpreter by this definition, because it contains a kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a more executable form (<a href="#syntax-tree">syntax trees</a>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the Perl <a href="#run-time">&quot;run time&quot;</a> system then interprets.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="invocant">invocant</dt>
<dd>

<p>The agent on whose behalf a <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> is invoked. In a <a href="#class">&quot;class&quot;</a> method, the invocant is a package name. In an <a href="#instance">&quot;instance&quot;</a> method, the invocant is an object reference.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="invocation">invocation</dt>
<dd>

<p>The act of calling up a deity, daemon, program, method, subroutine, or function to get it do what you think it&#39;s supposed to do. We usually &quot;call&quot; subroutines but &quot;invoke&quot; methods, since it sounds cooler.</p>

<dt id="is-a">is-a</dt>
<dd>

<p>A relationship between two <a href="#object">objects</a> in which one object is considered to be a more specific version of the other, generic object: &quot;A camel is a mammal.&quot; Since the generic object really only exists in a Platonic sense, we usually add a little abstraction to the notion of objects and think of the relationship as being between a generic <a href="#base-class">&quot;base class&quot;</a> and a specific <a href="#derived-class">&quot;derived class&quot;</a>. Oddly enough, Platonic classes don&#39;t always have Platonic relationships--see <a href="#inheritance">&quot;inheritance&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>A special programming gizmo that keeps track of where you are in something that you&#39;re trying to iterate over. The <code><code>foreach</code></code> loop in Perl contains an iterator; so does a hash, allowing you to <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#each">each</a> through it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="IV">IV</dt>
<dd>

<p>The integer four, not to be confused with six, Tom&#39;s favorite editor. IV also means an internal Integer Value of the type a <a href="#scalar">&quot;scalar&quot;</a> can hold, not to be confused with an <a href="#NV">&quot;NV&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="library">library</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="line-number">line number</dt>
<dd>

<p>The number of lines read previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line number for each source or input file it opens. The current source file&#39;s line number is represented by <code><code>__LINE__</code></code>. The current input line number (for the file that was most recently read via <code><code>&lt;FH&gt;</code></code>) is represented by the <code><code>$.</code></code> (<code><code>$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER</code></code>) variable. Many error messages report both values, if available.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="link">link</dt>
<dd>

<p>Used as a noun, a name in a <a href="#directory">&quot;directory&quot;</a>, representing a <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a>. A given file can have multiple links to it. It&#39;s like having the same phone number listed in the phone directory under different names. As a verb, to resolve a partially compiled file&#39;s unresolved symbols into a (nearly) executable image. Linking can generally be static or dynamic, which has nothing to do with static or dynamic scoping.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="LIST">LIST</dt>
<dd>

<p>A syntactic construct representing a comma-separated list of expressions, evaluated to produce a <a href="#list-value">&quot;list value&quot;</a>.

</dd>
<dt id="list-context">list context</dt>
<dd>

<p>The situation in which an <a href="#expression">&quot;expression&quot;</a> is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a list of values rather than a single value. Functions that want a <a href="#LIST">&quot;LIST&quot;</a> of arguments tell those arguments that they should produce a list value. See also <a href="#context">&quot;context&quot;</a>.</p>

The &quot;l&quot; is short for &quot;left&quot;, as in the left side of an assignment, a typical place for lvalues. An <a href="#lvaluable">&quot;lvaluable&quot;</a> function or expression is one to which a value may be assigned, as in <code><code>pos($x) = 10</code></code>.</p>

<dt id="memory">memory</dt>
<dd>

<p>This always means your main memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that your machine may implement <a href="#virtual">&quot;virtual&quot;</a> memory; that is, it will pretend that it has more memory than it really does, and it&#39;ll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a little more memory than you really do, but it&#39;s not a substitute for real memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run out of real memory. But your program can die when you run out of virtual memory too, if you haven&#39;t thrashed your disk to death first.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="metacharacter">metacharacter</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#character">&quot;character&quot;</a> that is <i>not</i> supposed to be treated normally.

<p>Something we&#39;d call a <a href="#metacharacter">&quot;metacharacter&quot;</a> except that it&#39;s a sequence of more than one character. Generally, the first character in the sequence must be a true metacharacter to get the other characters in the metasymbol to misbehave along with it.</p>

<dt id="null-string">null string</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> containing no characters, not to be confused with a string containing a <a href="#null-character">&quot;null character&quot;</a>, which has a positive length and is <a href="#true">&quot;true&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="numeric-context">numeric context</dt>
<dd>

<p>The situation in which an expression is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a number. See also <a href="#context">&quot;context&quot;</a> and <a href="#string-context">&quot;string context&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="NV">NV</dt>
<dd>

<p>Short for Nevada, no part of which will ever be confused with civilization. NV also means an internal floating-point Numeric Value of the type a <a href="#scalar">&quot;scalar&quot;</a> can hold, not to be confused with an <a href="#IV">&quot;IV&quot;</a>.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="object">object</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#instance">&quot;instance&quot;</a> of a <a href="#class">&quot;class&quot;</a>. Something that &quot;knows&quot; what user-defined type (class) it is, and what it can do because of what class it is. Your program can request an object to do things, but the object gets to decide whether it wants to do them or not. Some objects are more accommodating than others.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="octal">octal</dt>
<dd>

<p>A number in base 8. Only the digits 0 through 7 are allowed. Octal constants in Perl start with 0, as in 013. See also the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#oct">oct</a> function.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="offset">offset</dt>
<dd>

<p>How many things you have to skip over when moving from the beginning of a string or array to a specific position within it. Thus, the minimum offset is zero, not one, because you don&#39;t skip anything to get to the first item.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="one-liner">one-liner</dt>

<dt id="operating-system">operating system</dt>
<dd>

<p>A special program that runs on the bare machine and hides the gory details of managing <a href="#process">processes</a> and <a href="#device">devices</a>. Usually used in a looser sense to indicate a particular culture of programming. The loose sense can be used at varying levels of specificity. At one extreme, you might say that all versions of Unix and Unix-lookalikes are the same operating system (upsetting many people, especially lawyers and other advocates). At the other extreme, you could say this particular version of this particular vendor&#39;s operating system is different from any other version of this or any other vendor&#39;s operating system. Perl is much more portable across operating systems than many other languages. See also <a href="#architecture">&quot;architecture&quot;</a> and <a href="#platform">&quot;platform&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="operator">operator</dt>
<dd>

<p>A gizmo that transforms some number of input values to some number of output values, often built into a language with a special syntax or symbol. A given operator may have specific expectations about what <a href="#type">types</a> of data you give as its arguments (<a href="#operand">operands</a>) and what type of data you want back from it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="operator-overloading">operator overloading</dt>
<dd>

<p>A kind of <a href="#overloading">&quot;overloading&quot;</a> that you can do on built-in <a href="#operator">operators</a> to make them work on <a href="#object">objects</a> as if the objects were ordinary scalar values, but with the actual semantics supplied by the object class.

</dd>
<dt id="overriding">overriding</dt>
<dd>

<p>Hiding or invalidating some other definition of the same name. (Not to be confused with <a href="#overloading">&quot;overloading&quot;</a>, which adds definitions that must be disambiguated some other way.) To confuse the issue further, we use the word with two overloaded definitions: to describe how you can define your own <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> to hide a built-in <a href="#function">&quot;function&quot;</a> of the same name (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsub.html#Overriding-Built-in-Functions">&quot;Overriding Built-in Functions&quot; in perlsub</a>) and to describe how you can define a replacement <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a> in a <a href="#derived-class">&quot;derived class&quot;</a> to hide a <a href="#base-class">&quot;base class&quot;</a>&#39;s method of the same name (see <a href="../../lib/pods/perlobj.html">perlobj</a>).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="owner">owner</dt>
<dd>

<p>The one user (apart from the superuser) who has absolute control over a <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a>. A file may also have a <a href="#group">&quot;group&quot;</a> of users who may exercise joint ownership if the real owner permits it.

In a sense, only the package is global, since the symbols in the package&#39;s symbol table are only accessible from code compiled outside the package by naming the package. But in another sense, all package symbols are also globals--they&#39;re just well-organized globals.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PATH">PATH</dt>

<dd>

<p>The entire hardware and software context in which a program runs. A program written in a platform-dependent language might break if you change any of: machine, operating system, libraries, compiler, or system configuration.

<dd>

<p>A <a href="#variable">&quot;variable&quot;</a> in a language like C that contains the exact memory location of some other item. Perl handles pointers internally so you don&#39;t have to worry about them. Instead, you just use symbolic pointers in the form of <a href="#key">keys</a> and <a href="#variable">&quot;variable&quot;</a> names, or <a href="#hard-reference">hard references</a>, which aren&#39;t pointers (but act like pointers and do in fact contain pointers).</p>

<p>An instance of a running program. Under multitasking systems like Unix, two or more separate processes could be running the same program independently at the same time--in fact, the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#fork">fork</a> function is designed to bring about this happy state of affairs.

<dt id="regular-expression">regular expression</dt>
<dd>

<p>A single entity with various interpretations, like an elephant. To a computer scientist, it&#39;s a grammar for a little language in which some strings are legal and others aren&#39;t. To normal people, it&#39;s a pattern you can use to find what you&#39;re looking for when it varies from case to case. Perl&#39;s regular expressions are far from regular in the theoretical sense, but in regular use they work quite well. Here&#39;s a regular expression: <code><code>/Oh s.*t./</code></code>. This will match strings like &quot;<code><code>Oh say can you see by the dawn&#39;s early light</code></code>&quot; and &quot;<code><code>Oh sit!</code></code>&quot;.

<p>An <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> that says whether a particular ordering relationship is <a href="#true">&quot;true&quot;</a> about a pair of <a href="#operand">operands</a>.

<dt id="scalar-context">scalar context</dt>
<dd>

<p>The situation in which an <a href="#expression">&quot;expression&quot;</a> is expected by its surroundings (the code calling it) to return a single <a href="#value">&quot;value&quot;</a> rather than a <a href="#list">&quot;list&quot;</a> of values. See also <a href="#context">&quot;context&quot;</a> and <a href="#list-context">&quot;list context&quot;</a>. A scalar context sometimes imposes additional constraints on the return value--see <a href="#string-context">&quot;string context&quot;</a> and <a href="#numeric-context">&quot;numeric context&quot;</a>. Sometimes we talk about a <a href="#Boolean-context">&quot;Boolean context&quot;</a> inside conditionals, but this imposes no additional constraints, since any scalar value, whether numeric or <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a>, is already true or false.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="scalar-literal">scalar literal</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="scope">scope</dt>
<dd>

<p>How far away you can see a variable from, looking through one. Perl has two visibility mechanisms: it does <a href="#dynamic-scoping">&quot;dynamic scoping&quot;</a> of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#local">local</a> <a href="#variable">variables</a>, meaning that the rest of the <a href="#block">&quot;block&quot;</a>, and any <a href="#subroutine">subroutines</a> that are called by the rest of the block, can see the variables that are local to the block. Perl does <a href="#lexical-scoping">&quot;lexical scoping&quot;</a> of <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#my">my</a> variables, meaning that the rest of the block can see the variable, but other subroutines called by the block <i>cannot</i> see the variable.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="scratchpad">scratchpad</dt>

<dd>

<p>A text <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> that is a program intended to be <a href="#execute">executed</a> directly rather than <a href="#compiler">compiled</a> to another form of file before execution.

<dt id="separator">separator</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#character">&quot;character&quot;</a> or <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> that keeps two surrounding strings from being confused with each other. The <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#split">split</a> function works on separators. Not to be confused with <a href="#delimiter">delimiters</a> or <a href="#terminator">terminators</a>. The &quot;or&quot; in the previous sentence separated the two alternatives.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="service">service</dt>
<dd>

<p>Something you do for someone else to make them happy, like giving them the time of day (or of their life). On some machines, well-known services are listed by the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#getservent">getservent</a> function.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="setgid">setgid</dt>

<p>Same as <a href="#setuid">&quot;setuid&quot;</a>, only having to do with giving away <a href="#group">&quot;group&quot;</a> privileges.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="setuid">setuid</dt>
<dd>

<p>Said of a program that runs with the privileges of its <a href="#owner">&quot;owner&quot;</a> rather than (as is usually the case) the privileges of whoever is running it. Also describes the bit in the mode word (<a href="#permission-bits">&quot;permission bits&quot;</a>) that controls the feature. This bit must be explicitly set by the owner to enable this feature, and the program must be carefully written not to give away more privileges than it ought to.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="shebang">shebang</dt>
<dd>

<p>Irish for the whole McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a portmanteau of &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;bang&quot;, meaning the <code><code><span class="comment">#!</span>

</dd>
<dt id="shell">shell</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#command">&quot;command&quot;</a>-line <a href="#interpreter">&quot;interpreter&quot;</a>. The program that interactively gives you a prompt, accepts one or more <a href="#line">lines</a> of input, and executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them their proper <a href="#argument">arguments</a> and input data. Shells can also execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix, typical shells include the Bourne shell (<i>/bin/sh</i>), the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and the Korn shell (<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a shell because it&#39;s not interactive (although Perl programs can be interactive).</p>

</dd>
<dt id="side-effects">side effects</dt>
<dd>

<p>Something extra that happens when you evaluate an <a href="#expression">&quot;expression&quot;</a>. Nowadays it can refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple assignment statement typically has the &quot;side effect&quot; of assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning the value was your primary intent in the first place!) Likewise, assigning a value to the special variable <code><code>$|</code></code> (<code><code>$AUTOFLUSH</code></code>) has the side effect of forcing a flush after every <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#write">write</a> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#print">print</a> on the currently selected filehandle.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="signal">signal</dt>

<p>A <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a> that, instead of being content to be called in the normal fashion, sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it will deign to <a href="#execute">&quot;execute&quot;</a>. Under Perl, bolts out of the blue are called signals, and you send them with the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#kill">kill</a> built-in.

(See also <a href="#inheritance">&quot;inheritance&quot;</a> and <a href="#multiple-inheritance">&quot;multiple inheritance&quot;</a>.) In computer languages, the notion that <a href="#class">classes</a> reproduce asexually so that a given class can only have one direct ancestor or <a href="#base-class">&quot;base class&quot;</a>. Perl supplies no such restriction, though you may certainly program Perl that way if you like.</p>

<p>An endpoint for network communication among multiple <a href="#process">processes</a> that works much like a telephone or a post office box. The most important thing about a socket is its <a href="#network-address">&quot;network address&quot;</a> (like a phone number).

Represented within a Perl program by the <a href="#filehandle">&quot;filehandle&quot;</a> <a href="#STDERR">&quot;STDERR&quot;</a>. You can use this stream explicitly, but the <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#die">die</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#warn">warn</a> built-ins write to your standard error stream automatically.</p>

<dt id="standard-I-O">standard I/O</dt>
<dd>

<p>A standard C library for doing <a href="#buffer">buffered</a> input and output to the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a>. (The &quot;standard&quot; of standard I/O is only marginally related to the &quot;standard&quot; of standard input and output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation of standard I/O a given operating system supplies, so the buffering characteristics of a Perl program on one machine may not exactly match those on another machine. Normally this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want it to <a href="#flush">&quot;flush&quot;</a> the buffer more often, just set the <code><code>$|</code></code> variable to a true value.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="standard-input">standard input</dt>

<dt id="static">static</dt>
<dd>

<p>Varying slowly compared to something else. (Unfortunately, everything is relatively stable compared to something else, except for certain elementary particles, and we&#39;re not so sure about them.) In computers, where things are supposed to vary rapidly, &quot;static&quot; has a derogatory connotation, indicating a slightly dysfunctional <a href="#variable">&quot;variable&quot;</a>, <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a>, or <a href="#method">&quot;method&quot;</a>.

<p>The <a href="#value">&quot;value&quot;</a> returned to the parent <a href="#process">&quot;process&quot;</a> when one of its child processes dies. This value is placed in the special variable <code><code>$?</code></code>. Its upper eight <a href="#bit">bits</a> are the exit status of the defunct process, and its lower eight bits identify the signal (if any) that the process died from.

A subroutine is often parameterized to accomplish different but related things depending on its input <a href="#argument">arguments</a>.

<dt id="SV">SV</dt>
<dd>

<p>Short for &quot;scalar value&quot;. But within the Perl interpreter every <a href="#referent">&quot;referent&quot;</a> is treated as a member of a class derived from SV, in an object-oriented sort of way. Every <a href="#value">&quot;value&quot;</a> inside Perl is passed around as a C language <code><code>SV*</code></code> pointer. The SV <a href="#struct">&quot;struct&quot;</a> knows its own &quot;referent type&quot;, and the code is smart enough (we hope) not to try to call a <a href="#hash">&quot;hash&quot;</a> function on a <a href="#subroutine">&quot;subroutine&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="switch">switch</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="switch-statement">switch statement</dt>
<dd>

<p>A program technique that lets you evaluate an <a href="#expression">&quot;expression&quot;</a> and then, based on the value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a &quot;case structure&quot;, named after the similar Pascal construct. See See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlsyn.html#Basic-BLOCKs">&quot;Basic BLOCKs&quot; in perlsyn</a>.</p>

<dt id="symbol">symbol</dt>

<p>Generally, any <a href="#token">&quot;token&quot;</a> or <a href="#metasymbol">&quot;metasymbol&quot;</a>. Often used more specifically to mean the sort of name you might find in a <a href="#symbol-table">&quot;symbol table&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="symbol-table">symbol table</dt>
<dd>

<p>Where a <a href="#compiler">&quot;compiler&quot;</a> remembers symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember all the names of all the <a href="#variable">variables</a>, <a href="#filehandle">filehandles</a>, and <a href="#subroutine">subroutines</a> you&#39;ve used. It does this by placing the names in a symbol table, which is implemented in Perl using a <a href="#hash-table">&quot;hash table&quot;</a>. There is a separate symbol table for each <a href="#package">&quot;package&quot;</a> to give each package its own <a href="#namespace">&quot;namespace&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="symbolic-debugger">symbolic debugger</dt>
<dd>

<p>A program that lets you step through the <a href="#execute">execution</a> of your program, stopping or printing things out here and there to see whether anything has gone wrong, and if so, what. The &quot;symbolic&quot; part just means that you can talk to the debugger using the same symbols with which your program is written.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="symbolic-link">symbolic link</dt>
<dd>

<p>An alternate filename that points to the real <a href="#filename">&quot;filename&quot;</a>, which in turn points to the real <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a>. Whenever the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a> is trying to parse a <a href="#pathname">&quot;pathname&quot;</a> containing a symbolic link, it merely substitutes the new name and continues parsing.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="symbolic-reference">symbolic reference</dt>
<dd>

<p>A variable whose value is the name of another variable or subroutine. By <a href="#dereference">dereferencing</a> the first variable, you can get at the second one. Symbolic references are illegal under <a href="../../lib/strict.html#strict-refs">use strict &#39;refs&#39;</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="syscall">syscall</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#function">&quot;function&quot;</a> call directly to the <a href="#operating-system">&quot;operating system&quot;</a>. Many of the important subroutines and functions you use aren&#39;t direct system calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the system call level. In general, Perl programmers don&#39;t need to worry about the distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the <code><code>$!</code></code> (<code><code>$ERRNO</code></code>) variable on failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly employ the term &quot;system call&quot; to mean what happens when you call the Perl <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#system">system</a> function, which actually involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly always use say &quot;syscall&quot; for something you could call indirectly via Perl&#39;s <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#syscall">syscall</a> function, and never for something you would call with Perl&#39;s <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#system">system</a> function.</p>

<p>Short for a &quot;terminal&quot;, that is, a leaf node of a <a href="#syntax-tree">&quot;syntax tree&quot;</a>. A thing that functions grammatically as an <a href="#operand">&quot;operand&quot;</a> for the operators in an expression.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="terminator">terminator</dt>
<dd>

<p>A <a href="#character">&quot;character&quot;</a> or <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> that marks the end of another string. The <code><code>$/</code></code> variable contains the string that terminates a <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#readline">readline</a> operation, which <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chomp">chomp</a> deletes from the end. Not to be confused with <a href="#delimiter">delimiters</a> or <a href="#separator">separators</a>. The period at the end of this sentence is a terminator.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ternary">ternary</dt>
<dd>

<p>An <a href="#operator">&quot;operator&quot;</a> taking three <a href="#operand">operands</a>. Sometimes pronounced <a href="#trinary">&quot;trinary&quot;</a>.</p>

</dd>

<dd>

<p>A <a href="#string">&quot;string&quot;</a> or <a href="#file">&quot;file&quot;</a> containing primarily printable characters.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="thread">thread</dt>
<dd>

<p>Like a forked process, but without <a href="#fork">&quot;fork&quot;</a>&#39;s inherent memory protection. A thread is lighter weight than a full process, in that a process could have multiple threads running around in it, all fighting over the same process&#39;s memory space unless steps are taken to protect threads from each other. See <a href="../../lib/threads.html">threads</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="tie">tie</dt>
<dd>

<p>The bond between a magical variable and its implementation class. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#tie">&quot;tie&quot; in perlfunc</a> and <a href="../../lib/pods/perltie.html">perltie</a>.</p>

<dt id="TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</dt>
<dd>

<p>There&#39;s More Than One Way To Do It, the Perl Motto. The notion that there can be more than one valid path to solving a programming problem in context. (This doesn&#39;t mean that more ways are always better or that all possible paths are equally desirable--just that there need not be One True Way.) Pronounced TimToady.</p>

</dd>

</dd>
<dt id="tokenizing">tokenizing</dt>
<dd>

<p>Splitting up a program text into <a href="#token">tokens</a>. Also known as &quot;lexing&quot;, in which case you get &quot;lexemes&quot; instead of tokens.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="toolbox-approach">toolbox approach</dt>
<dd>

<p>The notion that, with a complete set of simple tools that work well together, you can build almost anything you want. Which is fine if you&#39;re assembling a tricycle, but if you&#39;re building a defranishizing comboflux regurgalator, you really want your own machine shop in which to build special tools. Perl is sort of a machine shop.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="transliterate">transliterate</dt>
<dd>

<p>To turn one string representation into another by mapping each character of the source string to its corresponding character in the result string. See <a href="../../lib/pods/perlop.html#tr-SEARCHLIST-REPLACEMENTLIST-cdsr">&quot;tr/SEARCHLIST/REPLACEMENTLIST/cdsr&quot; in perlop</a>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="typemap">typemap</dt>

<dd>

<p>An operator with only one <a href="#operand">&quot;operand&quot;</a>, like <code><code>!</code></code> or <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#chdir">chdir</a>.

</dd>
<dt id="Unix">Unix</dt>
<dd>

<p>A very large and constantly evolving language with several alternative and largely incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define anything any way they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this language think it&#39;s easy to learn because it&#39;s so easily twisted to one&#39;s own ends, but dialectical differences make tribal intercommunication nearly impossible, and travelers are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the language. To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must spend years of study in the art. Many have abandoned this discipline and now communicate via an Esperanto-like language called Perl.</p>

<p>In ancient times, Unix was also used to refer to some code that a couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a PDP-7 computer that wasn&#39;t doing much of anything else at the time.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="virtual">virtual</dt>
<dd>

<p>Providing the appearance of something without the reality, as in: virtual memory is not real memory. (See also <a href="#memory">&quot;memory&quot;</a>.) The opposite of &quot;virtual&quot; is &quot;transparent&quot;, which means providing the reality of something without the appearance, as in: Perl handles the variable-length UTF-8 character encoding transparently.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="void-context">void context</dt>

</dd>
<dt id="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</dt>

Usually used when something that appears on the screen matches how it will eventually look, like Perl&#39;s <a href="../../lib/pods/perlfunc.html#format">format</a> declarations.
