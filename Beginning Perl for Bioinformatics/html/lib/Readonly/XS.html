<p>Readonly::XS - Companion module for Readonly.pm, to speed up read-only scalar variables.</p>

<h1 id="VERSION">VERSION</h1>

<p>This document describes version 1.05 of Readonly::XS, February 24, 2009.</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code><code>  Install this module, but do not use it.</code></code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The Readonly module (q.v.) is an effective way to create non-modifiable variables. However, it&#39;s relatively slow.</p>

<p>The reason it&#39;s slow is that is implements the read-only-ness of variables via tied objects. This mechanism is inherently slow. Perl simply has to do a lot of work under the hood to make tied variables work.</p>

<p>This module corrects the speed problem, at least with respect to scalar variables. When Readonly::XS is installed, Readonly uses it to access the internals of scalar variables. Instead of creating a scalar variable object and tying it, Readonly simply flips the SvREADONLY bit in the scalar&#39;s FLAGS structure.</p>

<p>Readonly arrays and hashes are not sped up by this, since the SvREADONLY flag only works for scalars. Arrays and hashes always use the tie interface.</p>

<p>Why implement this as a separate module? Because not everyone can use XS. Not everyone has a C compiler. Also, installations with a statically-linked perl may not want to recompile their perl binary just for this module. Rather than render Readonly.pm useless for these people, the XS portion was put into a separate module.</p>

<p>Programs that you write do not need to know whether Readonly::XS is installed or not. They should just &quot;use Readonly&quot; and let Readonly worry about whether or not it can use XS. If the Readonly::XS is present, Readonly will be faster. If not, it won&#39;t. Either way, it will still work, and your code will not have to change.</p>

<p>Your program can check whether Readonly.pm is using XS or not by examining the $Readonly::XSokay variable. It will be true if the XS module was found and is being used. Please do not change this variable.</p>
