<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The <code><code>use utf8</code></code> pragma tells the Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the program text in the current lexical scope (allow UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms). The <code><code>no utf8</code></code> pragma tells Perl to switch back to treating the source text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.</p>

<p><b>Do not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that your script is written in UTF-8.</b> The utility functions described below are directly usable without <code><code><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">utf8</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</code></code>.</p>

<p>Because it is not possible to reliably tell UTF-8 from native 8 bit encodings, you need either a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of your source code, or <code><code><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="variable">utf8</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</code></code>, to instruct perl.</p>

<p>When UTF-8 becomes the standard source format, this pragma will effectively become a no-op. For convenience in what follows the term <i>UTF-X</i> is used to refer to UTF-8 on ASCII and ISO Latin based platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms.</p>

<p>See also the effects of the <code><code>-C</code></code> switch and its cousin, the <code><code><span class="variable">$ENV</span><span class="operator">{</span><span class="string">PERL_UNICODE</span><span class="operator">}</span>
</code></code>, in <a href="../lib/pods/perlrun.html">perlrun</a>.</p>

<p>Enabling the <code><code>utf8</code></code> pragma has the following effect:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated as being part of a literal UTF-X sequence. This includes most literals such as identifier names, string constants, and constant regular expression patterns.</p>

<p>On EBCDIC platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set are treated as being part of a literal UTF-EBCDIC character.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script (for example embedded Latin-1 in your string literals), <code><code>use utf8</code></code> will be unhappy since the bytes are most probably not well-formed UTF-X. If you want to have such bytes under <code><code>use utf8</code></code>, you can disable this pragma until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by <code><code><span class="keyword">no</span> <span class="variable">utf8</span><span class="operator">;</span>
</code></code>.</p>

<h2 id="Utility-functions">Utility functions</h2>

<p>The following functions are defined in the <code><code>utf8::</code></code> package by the Perl core. You do not need to say <code><code>use utf8</code></code> to use these and in fact you should not say that unless you really want to have UTF-8 source code.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>$num_octets = utf8::upgrade($string)</p>

<p>Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from an octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC) to <i>UTF-X</i>. The logical character sequence itself is unchanged. If <i>$string</i> is already stored as <i>UTF-X</i>, then this is a no-op. Returns the number of octets necessary to represent the string as <i>UTF-X</i>. Can be used to make sure that the UTF-8 flag is on, so that <code><code>\w</code></code> or <code><code>lc()</code></code> work as Unicode on strings containing characters in the range 0x80-0xFF (on ASCII and derivatives).</p>

<p><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</b> Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also <a href="../lib/Encode.html">Encode</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>$success = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK])</p>

<p>Converts in-place the internal representation of the string from <i>UTF-X</i> to the equivalent octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC). The logical character sequence itself is unchanged. If <i>$string</i> is already stored as native 8 bit, then this is a no-op. Can be used to make sure that the UTF-8 flag is off, e.g. when you want to make sure that the substr() or length() function works with the usually faster byte algorithm.</p>

<p>Fails if the original <i>UTF-X</i> sequence cannot be represented in the native 8 bit encoding. On failure dies or, if the value of <code><code>FAIL_OK</code></code> is true, returns false.</p>

<p>Returns true on success.</p>

<p><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</b> Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also <a href="../lib/Encode.html">Encode</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>utf8::encode($string)</p>

<p>Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding octet sequence in <i>UTF-X</i>. That is, every (possibly wide) character gets replaced with a sequence of one or more characters that represent the individual <i>UTF-X</i> bytes of the character. The UTF8 flag is turned off. Returns nothing.</p>

<pre><code><code>    <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"\x{100}"</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="comment"># $a contains one character, with ord 0x100</span>
    <span class="variable">utf8::encode</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">);</span>  <span class="comment"># $a contains two characters, with ords 0xc4 and 0x80</span>
</code></code></pre>

<p><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</b> Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also <a href="../lib/Encode.html">Encode</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>$success = utf8::decode($string)</p>

<p>Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence in <i>UTF-X</i> to the corresponding character sequence. That is, it replaces each sequence of characters in the string whose ords represent a valid UTF-X byte sequence, with the corresponding single character. The UTF-8 flag is turned on only if the source string contains multiple-byte <i>UTF-X</i> characters. If <i>$string</i> is invalid as <i>UTF-X</i>, returns false; otherwise returns true.</p>

<pre><code><code>    <span class="keyword">my</span> <span class="variable">$a</span> <span class="operator">=</span> <span class="string">"\xc4\x80"</span><span class="operator">;</span> <span class="comment"># $a contains two characters, with ords 0xc4 and 0x80</span>
    <span class="variable">utf8::decode</span><span class="operator">(</span><span class="variable">$a</span><span class="operator">);</span>   <span class="comment"># $a contains one character, with ord 0x100</span>
</code></code></pre>

<p><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary encodings.</b> Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes; see also <a href="../lib/Encode.html">Encode</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>$flag = utf8::is_utf8(STRING)</p>

<p>(Since Perl 5.8.1) Test whether STRING is in UTF-8 internally. Functionally the same as Encode::is_utf8().</p>

</li>
<li><p>$flag = utf8::valid(STRING)</p>

<p>[INTERNAL] Test whether STRING is in a consistent state regarding UTF-8. Will return true is well-formed UTF-8 and has the UTF-8 flag on <b>or</b> if string is held as bytes (both these states are &#39;consistent&#39;). Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl&#39;s testsuite to check that operations have left strings in a consistent state. You most probably want to use utf8::is_utf8() instead.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><code><code>utf8::encode</code></code> is like <code><code>utf8::upgrade</code></code>, but the UTF8 flag is cleared. See <a href="../lib/pods/perlunicode.html">perlunicode</a> for more on the UTF8 flag and the C API functions <code><code>sv_utf8_upgrade</code></code>, <code><code>sv_utf8_downgrade</code></code>, <code><code>sv_utf8_encode</code></code>, and <code><code>sv_utf8_decode</code></code>, which are wrapped by the Perl functions <code><code>utf8::upgrade</code></code>, <code><code>utf8::downgrade</code></code>, <code><code>utf8::encode</code></code> and <code><code>utf8::decode</code></code>. Also, the functions utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid, utf8::encode, utf8::decode, utf8::upgrade, and utf8::downgrade are actually internal, and thus always available, without a <code><code>require utf8</code></code> statement.</p>

<h1 id="BUGS">BUGS</h1>

<p>One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or subroutine names. While some limited functionality towards this does exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.</p>

<p>One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of the filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren&#39;t portable answers.</p>
